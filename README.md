# NYC Data Science Academy Deep Learning Course

This repository is for students of the in-classroom [Deep Learning course](nycdatascience.com/courses/deep-learning/) offered by Jon Krohn at the NYC Data Science Academy. 

## Installation

Detailed instructions for installing all of the software needed for the course are available [here](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/nyc-ds-academy/tree/master/installation). 

## Test Notebook

From the first unit of the course, we will be creating Jupyter notebooks to interactively build Deep Learning models. To test whether your install of TensorFlow was successful, you can try running the test notebook [here](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/nyc-ds-academy/blob/master/notebooks/test.ipynb).
